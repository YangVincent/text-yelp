As such, it is extremely difficult for them to find out about exciting new locations when traveling, or away from the\r\ncomputer. This allows users to access Yelp through text. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, many people have trouble deciding where to go. This helps users randomly decide a user-specified number\r\nof options to choose from, to help eliminate decision fatigue.\r\n\r\nAs such, there are three main features to this program:\r\n\r\n1. Allow non-smartphones to still search for Yelp results, whereas they wouldn't normally be able to\r\n2. Randomly choose an option to combat group indecision when choosing a place to go\r\n3. Find details about results (phone number, address, ratings) \r\n\r\n####Usage Instructions\r\nCurrently, verified numbers can message `+16503977854` via. SMS. If the message is from a registered number, the response will greet by name. \r\nText `usage` to `+16503977854` to see how to use the application. \r\n\r\n1. Unfortunately, the Twilio account used is on the free version, but you can sign into [TextFree](textfree.us) to use the registered number `+15302978104`. \r\n2. The username and password are both `yelpandchill`. To input newlines as specified in the example from desktop, press `shift+enter`.\r\nFor the time being until I can find an application that can receive long messages from Twilio, there are certain constraints. \r\n\r\n`usage` typically texts back\r\n\r\n```\r\nSent from your Twilio trial account - Usage:\r\n1st line is the tool you'd like to use - yac or random\r\n2nd line is the current location (e.g. San Diego)\r\n3rd line is your search string\r\n4th line is the number of random options you'd like to be shown\r\nHere are examples:\r\n\r\nyac\r\nSan Diego\r\nEscape Room\r\n\r\nwill return all results for 'Escape Room' in San Diego\r\n\r\nrandom\r\nSan Diego\r\nEscape Room\r\n4\r\n\r\nwill return 4 random results for 'Escape Room' in San Diego\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo use the TextFree application, I suggest using the `random` option to limit the length of reply. An example would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrandom\r\nSan Diego\r\nEscape Room\r\n3\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, an example of a response for general `yac` usage with the request:\r\n\r\n```\r\nyac\r\nsan diego\r\nescape room\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSent from your Twilio trial account - Powered by Yelp\r\nGreat Room Escape San Diego\r\nEscape Room Police\r\nRyptic Room Escape\r\nEscapism Puzzle Room\r\nEscape Game SD\r\nThe Puzzalarium\r\nEnigma HQ\r\nHouse of Hints\r\nDivergent Realities\r\nSteal and Escape\r\nThe Entrapment\r\nQuicksand Escape Games\r\n3rd Day Escape\r\nFeet First Eventertainment\r\nEscapology\r\nNate's Point Dog Park - Balboa Park\r\nBalboa Park\r\nPoint Loma Sports Club\r\nSan Diego Zoo\r\nKensington Club\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, the user can ask for details: for the example \r\n```\r\nDetail\r\nSan Diego\r\nBalboa Park\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reply is\r\n```\r\nSent from your Twilio trial account - Powered by Yelp\r\n\r\nBalboa Park\r\nPhone: +1-619-239-0512\r\nAddress: 1549 El Prado\r\nBalboa Park\r\nSan Diego, CA 92101\r\n5.0/5 over 1443 reviews\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCreated by Vincent Yang (@YangVincent) and Annie Tu (@annietuu).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have an issue or further suggestions, please use our [issue tracker](https://github.com/YangVincent/yelp-and-chill/issues).
